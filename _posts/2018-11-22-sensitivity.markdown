Marine scientists often assess the causes of variations
in CO2 system variables are by applying a
Taylor series decomposition, but results don't always add up. For
example, with $$pCO2 = f(DIC, Alk, T, S)$$, we often rely on a
first-order Taylor-series decomposition to quantify the
contributions the total change in pCO2
