description: New tools to easily propagate uncertainties for marine CO<sub>2</sub> system
---

Have you ever wanted to include uncertainties along with calculated
marine CO<sub>2</sub> system variables, but were frustrated by the effort
required? Well, the job has just gotten a lot easier, so read on.

Marine scientists who study ocean carbon and related variables often use
two measured or modeled CO<sub>2</sub> system variables to calculate
the others, taking advantage of available public software
packages. For instance, ocean pH is often calculated, not
measured. But what about the uncertainties associated with those
calculations? Unfortunately, they are seldom reported because
none of the packages have provided an uncertainty propagation feature.

The few groups that have reported uncertainties have relied on
different approaches, different input uncertainties, and in some cases
non-regionally specific sensitivities of calculated variables to input
variables.

To allow such uncertainty propagation to become commonplace, the
[OA-ICC](https://www.iaea.org/services/oa-icc) funded an effort to
provide a consistent set of tools in several public packages.
Uncertainty propagation add-ons are now available for four public
packages: [CO2SYS-Excel](https://github.com/jamesorr/CO2SYS-Excel),
[CO2SYS-MATLAB](https://github.com/jamesorr/CO2SYS-MATLAB),
[seacarb](http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=seacarb), and
[mocsy](https://github.com/jamesorr/mocsy).  Those links lead
directly to the archives from which these packages can be downloaded,
on CRAN for seacarb and on GitHub for the other 3 packages.

The interface for the CO2SYS-Excel add-on comes imbedded as an
additional "fourth" Excel sheet, where input uncertainties (standard
uncertainties) are specified and where calculated uncertainties
(combined standard uncertainties) are displayed (after clicking the
red START button on Sheet 3). For the add-ons to the other three
packages, each is provided as a new routine called "errors". Its
arguments are just like those for the preexisting routine that
computes carbonate chemistry variables (`CO2SYS.m`, `carb.R`, and
`vars.f90`, respectively) except that there is also a new line of
arguments for the input uncertainties.  Besides the typical type of
documentation for each package, the new archives for CO2SYS-MATLAB,
seacarb, and mocsy also contain a `notebooks` directory for extensive
examples using `jupyter` notebooks.  One may simply click on those
files to visualize their contents as HTML. Otherwise they may be
downloaded and run interactively as jupyter notebooks.

A new publication details this effort to provide CO<sub>2</sub> system
uncertainty propagation as a standard feature of relevant software
packages, while interpreting the first results (Orr et al., 2018).
