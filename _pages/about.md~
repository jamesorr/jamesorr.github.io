I am a Senior Scientist at the Climate and Environment Sciences Lab
([LSCE](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/en/)) of the French
[CEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Alternative_Energies_and_Atomic_Energy_Commission),
which I joined in 1992 following a Ph.D. in Oceanography from Texas
A&M University and postdoctoral research at Princeton University.  My
main research focuses on how the ocean is changing due to human-caused
increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and the associated changes in
climate. Those external stressors alter ocean carbon storage and
affect ocean chemistry and biology.  Typically I use ocean models
constrained by observations to help characterize trends, variability,
and extremes in carbon and related variables in the ocean.

Currently, I serve as Chair of the SOLAS-IMBER Working Group on Ocean
Acidification
([SIOA](http://www.imber.info/en/science/working-groups-1/solas-imber-carbon-sic/subgroup-3-ocean-acidification-sioa-1))
and as co-Chair the Ocean Model Intercomparison Project
([OMIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/cmip6-endorsed-mips-article/1063-modelling-cmip6-omip)),
which includes
[physical](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/3231/2016/) and
[biogeochemical](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/2169/2017/)
components and is part of Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project
([CMIP6](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/1937/2016/gmd-9-1937-2016.html)).
