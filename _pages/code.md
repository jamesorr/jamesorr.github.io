1. *mocsy* - improved routines to model the ocean carbonate system (Fortran, usable in Python)
  - [publication](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/8/485/2015)
  - [code](https://github.com/jamesorr/mocsy)

2. *fastspline* - the fastest cubic spline in the west [(Weinart, 2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947308005045) written in MATLAB was converted to Fortran (and is usable in Python)
  - [code](https://github.com/jamesorr/fastspline)

3. *seacarb* - computes seawater carbonate system parameters (R)
  - [CRAN archive](http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=seacarb)
  - [GitHub archive](https://github.com/jpgattuso/seacarb-git)

4. *errors* - routine to propagate uncertainties for the marine CO<sub>2</sub> system
  - available as an extra sheet in to [CO2SYS-Excel](https://github.com/jamesorr/CO2SYS-Excel) (used in Excel)
  - available as add-on to [CO2SYS-MATLAB](https://github.com/jamesorr/CO2SYS-MATLAB) (used in MATLAB or Octave)
  - also available within [mocsy](https://github.com/jamesorr/mocsy) and [seacarb](http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=seacarb) packages

5. *derivnum* - routine that calculates sensitivities (buffer factors) for the marine CO<sub>2</sub> system
  - available as add-on to [CO2SYS-MATLAB](https://github.com/jamesorr/CO2SYS-MATLAB) (used in MATLAB or Octave)
  - also available within the [mocsy](https://github.com/jamesorr/mocsy) and [seacarb](http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=seacarb) packages
